# NFTunes
NFTunes is a new NFT marketplace built on the FLOW blockchain network. It uses custom smart contracts written in cadence, a react frontend, and user authentication with Blocto. NFTunes is designed for music artists to sell lyrics of their songs as digital collectables.
# Design
During the creation of NFTunes we wanted the marketplace to capture the aesthetic of a classic 1970s record store.  We loved the idea of a modern take on buying records through the use of blockchain.  Our NFTs are designed to look like records and the marketplace uses similar colors and styles one would see back in the 70s.  
## What are NFTS?
A non-fungible token is a unique and non-interchangeable unit of data stored on a digital ledger. NFTs can be associated with easily-reproducible items such as photos, videos, audio, and other types of digital files as unique items, and use blockchain technology to give the NFT a public proof of ownership.

## What is FLOW?
Flow is a decentralized, fast, and developer-centric blockchain tailored for encouraging the growth of a completely new assortment of apps, games, and digital assets. Flow blockchain utilizes a distinct, multi-role architecture that focuses on the inherent benefit of scaling without sharding.

## Future Goals?
The NFTunes team hopes that one day users will be able to collect and trade actual song lyrics. For the firs time in history users will get a unique, personal connection to their favorite artists and be able to own parts of their favorite songs.
